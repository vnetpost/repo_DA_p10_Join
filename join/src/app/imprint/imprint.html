    <h2>Disclaimer</h2>

    <h3>Liability for Content</h3>
    <p>
      The contents of our pages have been created with the greatest care. However, we cannot
      guarantee the accuracy, completeness, or timeliness of the content. As a service provider, we
      are responsible for our own content on these pages in accordance with Section 7(1) DDG and
      general laws. According to Sections 8 to 10 DDG, we are not obliged to monitor transmitted or
      stored third-party information or to investigate circumstances that indicate illegal activity.
      Obligations to remove or block the use of information in accordance with general laws remain
      unaffected. Liability in this respect is only possible from the time we become aware of a
      specific legal violation. Upon becoming aware of such legal violations, we will remove the
      affected content immediately.
    </p>

    <h3>Liability for Links</h3>
    <p>
      Our website contains links to external third-party websites over whose content we have no
      control. Therefore, we cannot assume any liability for this external content. The respective
      provider or operator of the linked pages is always responsible for their content. The linked
      pages were checked for possible legal violations at the time of linking. Illegal content was
      not identifiable at the time of linking. Permanent monitoring of the content of linked pages
      is not reasonable without concrete evidence of a legal violation. Upon becoming aware of legal
      violations, we will remove such links immediately.
    </p>

    <h3>Copyright</h3>
    <p>
      The content and works created by the site operator on these pages are subject to German
      copyright law. Duplication, processing, distribution, and any form of exploitation beyond the
      limits of copyright law require the written consent of the respective author or creator.
      Downloads and copies of this site are permitted for private, non-commercial use only. Insofar
      as the content on this site was not created by the operator, the copyrights of third parties
      are respected. In particular, third-party content is identified as such. Should you
      nevertheless become aware of a copyright infringement, please inform us accordingly. Upon
      becoming aware of legal violations, we will remove such content immediately.

    <h3>Data Protection</h3>
    <p>
      The use of our website is generally possible without providing personal data. Where personal
      data (such as name, address, or email addresses) is collected on our pages, this is done, as
      far as possible, on a voluntary basis. This data will not be passed on to third parties
      without your explicit consent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Please note that data transmission over the Internet (e.g. communication via email) may have
      security vulnerabilities. Complete protection of data against access by third parties is not
      possible.
    </p>

      The use of contact data published as part of the legal notice obligation by third parties for
      the purpose of sending unsolicited advertising and information materials is hereby expressly
      prohibited. The site operator expressly reserves the right to take legal action in the event
      of the unsolicited sending of advertising information, such as spam emails.
