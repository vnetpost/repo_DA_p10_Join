        <p>
        When you access our website, i.e. if you do not register or otherwise submit information,
        information of a general nature is automatically collected. This information (server log
        files) includes, for example, the type of web browser, the operating system used, the domain
        name of your Internet service provider, your IP address, and similar data.
        </p>

        <p>In particular, this data is processed for the following purposes:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Ensuring a smooth connection to the website</li>
        <li>Ensuring smooth use of the website</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
        We do not use your data to draw conclusions about your identity. However, we reserve the right
        to retrospectively review the server log files if there are concrete indications of unlawful
        use.
        </p>

        <h4>Legal Basis and Legitimate Interest</h4>
        <p>
        Processing is carried out in accordance with Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR based on our legitimate

        for a maximum period of [please provide information], unless a security-relevant event occurs
        (e.g. a DDoS attack).
        </p>
        <p>
        In the event of such an incident, server log files are stored until the security-related event
        has been resolved and fully clarified.
        </p>

        <h4>Mandatory or Required Provision</h4>
        <p>
        The provision of the aforementioned personal data is neither legally nor contractually

        <h2>Information on Your Right to Object Under Art. 21 GDPR</h2>

        <h3>Right to Object on a Case-by-Case Basis</h3>
        <p>
        You have the right to object at any time, on grounds relating to your particular situation, to
        the processing of personal data concerning you which is based on Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR (data

        freedoms, or the processing serves the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims.
